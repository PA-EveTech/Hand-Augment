# Hand Augment Project

The goal of this project is to create a hand augment to restore hand movement to people with hand paralysis or other forms of neuromuscular disabilities which prevent easy use of their hands. This repo details our classification code which takes in raw EMG data as input and classifies it as one of several gestures. 

Note: this is a work in progress

## Dependencies

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn

## TODO

- Figure out which classifier to use (SVM seems too weak)
- Need more literature review 
- Consider using a different dataset
